# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 100 (from the original 1000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

Sampling Steps:

1) Method: Simple Random Sampling 
   Frame: 1000 people (event attendees)
   Size: 100 (10%)
   Each person has an equal probability of being infected
   Code used is np.random.choice

2) Method: Simple Random Sampling
   Frame: Previously infected individuals
   Size: 0.20 of the frame
   Sampled with a probability of being traced
   Code used is np.random.choice

3) Method: Cluster sampling, events as clusters
   Frame: All event attendees
   Size: varies depending on how many meet the threshold
   Conditional probability
   Code includes event types, divvying into clusters
   
This code doesn't produce the graphs from the original blog post. In the blog post, the red (observed) distribution is more widely spread out and shifted to the right and the mean observed proportion is around double the true proportion. In the graphs produced, the red and blue distributions have more overlap and are less spread out. 

After modifying the code and running the script 5 times, I observe the results are very inconsistent, therefore do not appear to be reproducible.

Adding a seed made the results much more consistent. After rerunning the new script a few times, I see reproducibility is achieved. The graphs display the same distributions.
As suggested in the question, they're not similar to the ones in the blog post.cd
