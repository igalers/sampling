# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `2`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose is to get insights from voters on key issues, leadership qualities and campaign priorities.
The insights gathered will inform decisions on which issues to focus on, outreach strategies and allocation of funding.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: Eligible voters in Canada who are likely to vote in the upcoming federal election

Sampling Frame: A mix of registered voter databases, online groups and phone surveys

Sampling Units: Individual eligible voters

Sampling strategy: Multi Stage Mixed Use Strategy 
1st Stage: Stratified sampling - diving the population into strata geographically across provinces and territories
2nd Stage: Cluster sampling - within each stratum, selecting clusters such neighborhoods with urban areas, and households for phone or in-person surveys
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. How likely are you to vote in the upcoming election?
-very likely
-likely
-unlikely
-very unlikely

2. Which of the following issues is most important to you when deciding whom to vote for? (Select up to three)
-Economy and job creation
-Healthcare and affordability of services
-Climate change and environmental policies
-Education and student support
-Housing affordability and availability
-National security and public safety
-Indigenous rights and reconciliation
-Taxes and government spending
-Other (please specify)

3. How satisfied are you with our party's performance during this campaign? (1 = Very dissatisfied, 10 = Very satisfied)

4. Which party do you currently intend to vote for?
-Our party
-Main opposition
-Another party
-Undecided

5. What is your primary source of political information?
-Traditional media(TV, newspapers, radio)
-Social media(Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok)
-Political party websites and party-affiliated online groups
-Word of mouth/discussions with family and friends
-Other(please specify)

6. Do you have any additional comments on how our party can secure your vote in this election? (Open-ended)
```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type: a two-stage stratified sample design with a cross-sectional approach
2. Sample size: approximately 21000
3. Target population: The target population for the GSS Giving, volunteering and participating includes all persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada. 
                      It excludes full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions.
4. Sampling frame: A combined frame of landline and cellular telephone numbers derived from the Census and various administrative sources, linked to Statistics Canada's dwelling frame
5. Survey mode(s): Data are collected directly from survey respondents either through an electronic questionnaire or through CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing)
6. Timeline: Every 5 years, from September to December
7. Response rate: The overall response rate is 41.9%
8. Weights: WGHT_PER: This is the basic weighting factor for analysis at the person level, i.e. to calculate estimates of the number of persons (non-institutionalized and aged 15 or over) having one or several given characteristics.
                      In addition to the estimation weights, bootstrap weights have been created for the purpose of design-based variance estimation.
9. Data processing: All survey records were subjected to computer edits throughout the course of the interview. 
                    The CATI system principally edited the flow of the questionnaire and identified out of range values. 
                    If the interviewer was unable to correctly resolve the detected errors, the interviewer bypassed the edit and forwarded the data to head office for resolution. 
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc: Except in a few cases, all imputations were made using donor records selected through a score function. 
                               Where donor imputation could not be used, mean imputation among a pool of donors was used.
11. Sources of error: Sampling error, Non-sampling error, Coverage error, Other non-sampling errors 
12. Limitations, known biases, etc: Non-response bias
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/89F0115X
